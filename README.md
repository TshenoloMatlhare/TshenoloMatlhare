I am a studenta at the University of the Free State, currently pursuing an Honours degree in Business and Financial Analytics.
I am very keen and always so exicited to use work with data and draw meaningful insights from it that can provide solutions and make contributions to economics and finacial issues.
### 🔬 Research Interests
- Digital behaviour indicators (Google Trends, social media signals)
- Labour market analytics and unemployment modelling  
- Bayesian networks & probabilistic reasoning  
- Time-series forecasting and anomaly detection  
- Macro- and micro-economic measurement challenges

  I’m continuously learning, experimenting, and refining my analytical toolkit — with a focus on clear, meaningful insights grounded in data.
