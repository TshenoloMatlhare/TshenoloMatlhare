#**About me**
I am a B.Com in Economics Sciences with Economterics graduate from the North West University and currently persuing an Honours in Business and Financial Analytics at the University of the Free State (UFS).

I am interested in data to provide insights into economic and financial solutions that have an impact. I have academic and project experience in machine learning, anomaly detection, Bayesian networks, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and econometric analysis — all in applied contexts for decision making.

My areas of research interest are:
• Labour markets and modelling unemployment
• Economic forecasts using alternative data sources (e.g. Google Trends)
• Behavioural insights in retail behaviours and decision-making
• Machine learning methods to financial and economic analytics
• Data-driven public policy and development economics

I try to build solutions that merge data science to economics, helping organisations and policy makers to better understand behaviour, markets and risk.
